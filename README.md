# Flutter Animations Tasks

### Opacity Transition:
- Create a widget that fades in and out using an opacity animation.

### Color Transition:
- Animate a container's background color from one color to another.

### Position Transition:
- Move a widget from one position to another within a container.

### Scale Transition:
- Create a widget that scales up and down.

### Rotation Transition:
- Rotate a widget around its center point.

### Size Transition:
- Animate the size of a widget, growing it from zero to its full size.

### Shape Transition:
- Animate the border radius of a container to transform it from a circle to a square and vice versa.

### Multiple Property Animations:
- Combine multiple tweens to animate opacity, position, and size of a widget simultaneously.

### Curve Animation:
- Apply different easing curves (like Curves.easeInOut, Curves.bounceInOut) to tweens and see how the animation behavior changes.

### Animated Icon:
- Create an icon that animates between different states (e.g., play to pause).
